# Sentinel E2E Automation (Playwright)

## Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end (E2E) automation for a login flow using Playwright.

It was intentionally designed and implemented to showcase clean automation structure,
Page Object Model usage, stable validations, and secure environment-based configuration
for authentication workflows.

---

## Tech Stack

- Playwright (TypeScript)
- Node.js
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Environment-based configuration (`.env`)

---

## Test Coverage

The automation suite covers the core login flow of the application, including:

- User authentication
- Page navigation and URL validation during login
- Post-login state verification

Additional authentication and post-login scenarios are intentionally archived
to maintain a focused and stable active scope.
